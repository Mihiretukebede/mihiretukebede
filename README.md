### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the division of Cancer Epidemiology at the German Cancer Research Centre(DKFZ) in Heidelberg. 
My current research is on a large systematic review project which aims to synthesize the evidence on key mechanistic pathways for the causal link between adiposity and gynecological cancers. 

My research interest is broad but generally in epidemiological and digital health research methods applied to diabetes, cancer, and other chronic diseases. 
Methodologically, I am interested in observational methods, systematic reviews and meta-analysis, and contemporary approaches such as machine learning applications in disease risk and health care prognosis prediction.
